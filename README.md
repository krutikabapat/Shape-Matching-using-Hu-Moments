# Shape_Matching-using-Hu-Moments
Similarity between two shapes can be calculates using Hu Moments in OpenCV. Hu Moments are seven values that are calculated of any Image containing the shape.  
These values are invarient to:-
1. Translation.  
2. Rotation.  
3. Shifting.   

## Usage:-  
1. <code> run Hu.py </code>
